This style changes the appearance of [The Old Reader](http://theoldreader.com/), my RSS aggregator of choice, to be more to my liking. It requires the Stylish extension, which is available for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylish/?src=external-userstyleshome) and [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fjnbnpbmkenffdnngjfgmeleoegfcffe).
