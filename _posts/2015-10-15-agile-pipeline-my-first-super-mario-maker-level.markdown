I got Super Mario Maker this week. When you first play the game, you only have a small number of tools available to make levels with, and as far as I can tell, the only way to unlock more features is to make levels with what few tools you do have.

I was worried when I was first looking into this game that levels would always either be completely uninspired or feel completely out of place. Instead I found that, even with such basic elements, one can easily craft fun, challenging and original levels that would feel right at home in a proper Mario game. Not that there's anything wrong with the more suprising, [wackier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcwgWIgL3f4) and... *[oddly-directed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SAawvn1cB8&t=51s)* stuff.

It's a shame that the game does not have a video uploading feature, or at least better quality screenshots, so that one may showcase their levels on the Internet, especially since [Mario Maker levels are regularly deleted to save server space](http://en.rocketnews24.com/2015/09/10/nintendo-will-delete-your-mario-maker-course-if-its-boring-can-make-a-buck-off-it-if-its-good/) (which, to be clear, I am not complaining about). I grabbed the one above from the level's [Miiverse post](https://miiverse.nintendo.net/posts/AYQHAAABAAAtVHhoD0tO3g). It's obviously not great quality, but what's more, it's also missing two enemies that would appear right away as well as Mario himself.

Overall, I am quite happy with the game and look forward to spending lots of time with it, though. I just hope Nintendo realizes its full potential and fixes its issues through free updates.
