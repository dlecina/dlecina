[StayPuft](https://github.com/dlecina/StayPuft), the theme I created to use in this blog, has finally been updated to version 1.1.3, which should work with [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) 0.5.6, as well as some older versions of the blogging platform.

Since there's been some general discussion about this theme in other, unrelated blog posts due to lack of a better place, I figured this update was a good moment to create a post where such discussion could take place (this one). For specific bugs or issues, please use the [corresponding section in GitHub](https://github.com/dlecina/StayPuft/issues).
