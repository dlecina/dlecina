It's once again time to release the next major update to [StayPuft](https://github.com/dlecina/StayPuft), my programming-oriented theme for [Ghost](https://ghost.org/).

Despite the fact that since the previous release I have found an easier way to integrate changes from [Casper](https://github.com/TryGhost/Casper), I have still found it difficult to find the time and motivation to update the theme. Nevertheless, here it is!

## Features

- Responsive design.
- Custom [âš¡AMP](https://blog.ghost.org/custom-amp-themes/) theme.
- Post comments using [Disqus](http://disqus.com/).
- In-site search using [GhostHunter](https://github.com/i11ume/ghostHunter).
- Support for [Font Awesome](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome).
- Syntax highlighting using [Prism](https://github.com/LeaVerou/prism/), with Markdown support.

## Ghost 2.13.1

The new version has been tested against Ghost 2.13.1 (i.e. that's the version I'm currently running), but it _should_ work on any version beyond Ghost 2.0.0 at the time of writing. If you would like to know what has changed on the backend, you can check out the [Ghost releases page](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/releases)[.](https://dev.ghost.org/tag/releases/)

If you need help upgrading Ghost itself, just follow the instructions in their own [Support page](https://docs.ghost.org/docs/upgrade).

## Installing StayPuft

If you're not yet using StayPuft and would like to try it out, just take a look at the Installation section over at [GitHub](https://github.com/dlecina/StayPuft#installation).

## Updating StayPuft

To update the theme from the previous version, get the [latest release](https://github.com/dlecina/StayPuft/releases/latest) and replace the files in `partials/custom` with your existing versions (no changes in this release). Then, you should only need to go to your blog's administration page and upload the new version in the Design section. For an even older version, please do a full installation.

Thanks for checking out the theme!
