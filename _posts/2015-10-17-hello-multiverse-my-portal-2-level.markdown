Since I'm posting [Super Mario Maker levels](http://davidlecina.com/blog/tag/super-mario-maker/) now, I figured I might as well post the first and only level I made for Portal 2: [Hello Multiverse](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=81354719). I thought the Portal 2 level editor was brilliant, but after beating both the Solo and Co-op *campaigns* I'd had my fill of the game and didn't feel motivated to play or make any more.

The chamber itself is fairly simple, but I felt like it was a good starting point at the time. Here's a play-through of it I just found, recorded by [DiscussorGameVideos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSzftgZgOjAHz7ZcABPcWCA).
